# EzbillVision_backend

Our app is named 'ezbill,' and we use facial recognition via the camera to calculate usage time for each tenant, generating personalized bills. 

This approach avoids the unfair situation in shared housing where all tenants have different usage patterns but end up splitting the bill equally.

The app's logic is quite simple. Regular tenants can view their own bills and a bar chart of their usage for the past 7 days.
On the other hand, the main tenant (or landlord) can see the bills of all tenants in the same house and a pie chart showing the usage of each tenant.
